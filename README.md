# Introduction
This repository contains my exploration of the "Animal Bites" dataset as part of my one-month remote internship at YoungDev Intern. The internship tasks involved utilizing pandas for data manipulation and analysis, as well as data visualization techniques to uncover insights from the dataset.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Exploring Dataset with Pandas**:
   - Calculated basic statistics like mean, median, and unique values for numerical columns.
   - Counted unique values in categorical columns.
2. **Exploring Insights with Data Visualization**:
   - Histogram of Number of Victims per Year: Revealed trends in bite incidents over time.
   - Distribution of Victims by Gender: Highlighted gender demographics of bite victims.
   - Number of Vaccinated Victims per Year: Tracked vaccination patterns.
3. **Exploring Data Aggregation & Grouping in Dataset**:
   - Grouped data by species and calculated mean vaccination years and other statistics for each group.

## Usage
